Built my own a full REST API service using Flask.
Many companies have collected valuable data e.g. Bitcoin prices, Restaurant reviews and provide an API for developers to access this data for a price.
Depending on how valuable the data/service is behind the API, these APIs can charge anywhere from $9 to $99 per month for access. Some even charge per API call.
